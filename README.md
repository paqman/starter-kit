Starter kit with angularjs and bootstrap
Don't forget to adapt wich version you wanna use (minified...) in index.html


**Update :**
Replaced linqjs with lodash (http://lodash.com/)
Removed font-awesome, cause I added bootstrap 3.0
Still waiting for Angularjs 1.2

## Angularjs *v. 1.0.7*
Javascript framework which allow you to build ultra dynamic web applications.
Powered by google

## Bootstrap *v. 3.0.0*
Mobile first CSS templating framework wich provide a structured working base for your website.
Powered by twitter

## Less *v. 1.5.0*
Less defines itself as a "dynamic stylesheet language". It reduce the redundance of CSS code and allow you to use functions.

## Lo-Dash *v. 2.2.1*
Great framework when you have to deal with data sets, collection... Allow you to "query" your tabs and extract datas.
Slightly like the .NET LINQ Framework.

## jQuery *v. 2.0.3*
Known all around the world, jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
